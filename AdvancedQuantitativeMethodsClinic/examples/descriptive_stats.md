# Descriptive statistics

1. Compute the frequency, the cumulative frequency and the percentile ranks
of samples given in [data-1]().
2. Compute the mean and median of samples in [data-2]().
3. What is the best way of showing the central tendency in the following distributions?
![normal-dist]()
![skewed-dist]()
![bimodal-dist]()
![uniform-dist]()
![no-bound-dist]()
4. Compute the variance of the following scores: 0,0,3,3,9,9. Now using a sample
size of N=2, compute the sample variance. You may have to use "sampling with
replacement".
